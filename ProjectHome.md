The original code appears to contain the beginnings of a console based Othello game. To run the game:
```
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/othello-by-newbie/
cd othello-by-newbie/
mvn install exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.denarced.Main"
```

Alternatively in Unix-like systems:
```
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/othello-by-newbie/
cd othello-by-newbie/
./run.sh
```
